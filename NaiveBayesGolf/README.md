# Implementation of a naive Bayes classifier for the Golf/Weather dataset.

Dataset taken from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlVINQDk4o8).

NOTE: The fellow in the video mis-counts "Sunny" (he counts 2 Yes, 3 No instead of 3 Yes, 2 No), 
leading to incorrect probabilities (he calculates 2/9 Yes, 3/5 No rather than 3/9 Yes, 2/5 No) and likelihoods.
